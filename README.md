# Build a Reusable Stepper as an Angular Library
## Convey your processâ€™s progress with a dynamic stepper

Flight booking, managing an invoice in SAP, creating a purchase order â€” what all of these processes have in common is the fact that they involve many steps to finish them. A purchase order, for example, consists of several compliance checkpoints, approval, and input tasks to ensure timely processing.

If you got the chance to build an enterprise application that handles similar processes, this means that multiple modules in your app should include the same user interface logic and you have to solve the same problem in many places.

You got it! You need to implement a customizable reusable component that conveys the processâ€™s progress and allows the data submission step by step, and thatâ€™s what weâ€™ll do here: https://medium.com/better-programming/angular-library-dynamic-stepper-2ba05ab40228

# Angular Library: A Dynamic Stepper

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.2.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
